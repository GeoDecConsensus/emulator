# GeoDec: Enhancing Blockchain Resilience through Geospatial Validator Distribution

GeoDec aims to address the geographic concentration of validator nodes in existing blockchain networks, particularly in the context of PoS consensus mechanisms. The project involves the development of an emulator to analyze geospatial distribution, the design of a geospatial-aware proposer selection mechanism, and the deployment of the revised protocol for evaluation.

### Progress

**Emulator Development**
- [x] Develop HotStuff emulator
- [ ] Extend emulator for Tendermint consensus mechanisms (like CometBFT)
    - [x] Implement install scripts
    - [x] Implement CometBFT run scripts
    - [ ] Read and write log files
    - [ ] Output summarized results

- [ ] Extend emulator for BullShark consensus mechanism
- [ ] Implement and improvise a modular and extensible code structure
- [ ] Get feedback from the community
- [ ] Improve emulator based on the feedback

### Vision
Success for GeoDec entails advancing geospatial decentralization in blockchain validator networks. The desired impact includes the development of a widely-used open-source emulator, an effective mechanism for geographically decentralized block proposers, and influential academic research. The goal is to set new standards for blockchain networks globally.

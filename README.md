# GeoDec: Enhancing Blockchain Resilience through Geospatial Validator Distribution

GeoDec aims to address the geographic concentration of validator nodes in existing blockchain networks, particularly in the context of PoS consensus mechanisms. The project involves the development of an emulator to analyze geospatial distribution, the design of a geospatial-aware proposer selection mechanism, and the deployment of the revised protocol for evaluation.

### Progress

**Emulator Development**
- [x] Develop HotStuff emulator
- [-] Extend emulator for Tendermint consensus mechanisms (like CometBFT)
- [ ] Extend emulator for BullShark consensus mechanism
- [ ] Implement and improvise a modular and extensible code structure
- [ ] Get feedback from the community on emulator
- [ ] Improve emulator based on feedback

<!-- 2. **Research and Design**
   - [ ] Conduct in-depth research on existing proposer selection methods (if any)
   - [ ] Investigate geospatial factors impacting consensus mechanisms
   - [ ] Design a geospatial-aware proposer selection mechanism
   - [ ] Look into security, loop holes and vulnerabilities in geospatial-based consensus

3. **Implementation and Integration**
  - [ ] Implement the geospatial-aware proposer selection mechanism
  - [ ] Integrate the new mechanism with the existing emulator
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for robustness
  - [ ] Get community feedback via emulator testing and feedback

4. **Deployment and Evaluation**
  - [ ] Deploy the protocol with the revised proposer selection mechanism
  - [ ] Develop a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing geospatial data
  - [ ] Collect and analyze key metrics
  - [ ] Evaluate the impact on decentralization -->

### Vision
Success for GeoDec entails advancing geospatial decentralization in blockchain validator networks. The desired impact includes the development of a widely-used open-source emulator, an effective mechanism for geographically decentralized block proposers, and influential academic research. The goal is to set new standards for blockchain networks globally.
